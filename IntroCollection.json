    "ShortIntro": "a NTC software development graduate",
    "School": "I graduated from Merrill High School in May 2017; I started college at USWP at the Wausau branch pursuing a degree in special education. I worked in early childhood settings while at UWSP and was a little over a semester from graduating when I decided to switch majors. I graduated from USWP with an associate degree and transferred to NTC to pursue a software development degree. I began at NTC in December 2020 and graduated May 2022 with a 3.8 GPA. This degree prepares me to design and develop desktop, web and mobile software using leading object-oriented programming languages and related technologies. I am proficient in C#, ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL.",
    "Family": "I was born and raised in Merrill WI. Both of my parents are educators in the area, and I have a younger sister attending USWP. My girlfriend and I live in a farmhouse in Pine River WI with our three beautiful pets. Our old dog Ouan, and our two cats Gwen and Strawberries.",
    "Hobbies": "I played basketball for UWSP while attending school there and still love to play with friends or in Rec leagues. I spend a lot of time outdoors at home or taking trips to other hiking spots in the area. I also like to find interesting coding projects to start in my free time, I am currently learning how to make a fighting game with JavaScript. Lastly, I enjoy all kinds of video games, but I have been playing Dorfromantik, Apex Legends and Risk of Rain 2 most recently.",
    "WhatsNew": "I graduated from NTC in May and have been looking for my first software development opportunity. However, I tore my ACL, MCL and Meniscus about 3-4 week before graduating and have been working very hard to get back to life before the injury. I am about halfway through the long recovery process and now feel well enough to begin looking for jobs. It will not affect my ability to work but I still have a lot of physical therapy to work though."
