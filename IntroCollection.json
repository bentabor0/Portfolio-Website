    "LongIntro": "I attended Merrill Highschool and graduated in 2017. After Highschool I attended UW-Marathon County and worked in multiple early childhood environments on my way to a bachelor’s degree in education. I wasn’t enjoying the education degree and decided it was time to switch majors. I decided to switch my major to Software Development and applied to NTC in December 2019. I am currently in my third semester at NTC and am on course to graduate in the Spring of 2022.",
